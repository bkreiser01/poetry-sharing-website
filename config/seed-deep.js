They love each other.\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\nAt home once more,\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\nFor she has walked over to me\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\nShe is black and white,\nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girlâ€™s wrist.\nSuddenly I realize\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\nInto blossom.",
